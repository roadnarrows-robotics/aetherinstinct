### ai.2 Auditory
_4D Binaural Neural Networks_

A collection of NNs that are to able sense sound,
within the hearing range of humans, and construct 
a model of the 4D real world in real-time.
The four dimensions are the three spatial and time.
Sound properties of frequency, amplitude, phase, and time with be used.

A set of two or more microphones are required in the production system.

#### Competencies
1. Convert temporal binaural sound into an internal TBD representation.
2. Locate sound origin.
3. Differentiate sounds.
4. Determine sound "sameness".

#### Limitations
1. Cannot identify the class or type sound (e.g. bell, crying baby, crow, etc).
