# ai.anim
This project explores AI for non-player character (NPC) realistic animations
in games and simulations.
Player here is equivalent to human. So non-human characters.
The AI approach is to seamlessly move NPCs, transitioning from one fixed action
pattern (FAP) to another. The FAPs are learned.
The environment and NPC intent are inputs to the NPC animation AI,
which decides on the appropriate FAP.
